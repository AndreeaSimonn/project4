        <h2>Chapter 2: The Pool of Tears</h2>

        <p>'Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); 'now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!'</p>

        <p>Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact, she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.</p>

        <p>Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.</p>

        <p>After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other.</p>

        <p>Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of anyone; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, 'If you please, sir—' The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.</p>

        <p>She took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: 'Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in the night?'</p>

        <p>'I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little!'</p>

        <p>She began to test herself: 'Four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify.'</p>

        <p>Then she tried Geography: 'London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome—no, that's all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been changed for Mabel!'</p>

        <p>As she said this, she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while she was talking.</p>

        <p>'How can I have done that?' she thought. 'I must be growing small again.' She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking rapidly.</p>

        <p>As she said these words, her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! She was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea.</p>

        <p>However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.</p>

        <p>'I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out.</p>

        <p>Just then, she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first, she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.</p>

        <p>‘Would it be of any use, now,’ thought Alice, ‘to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.’</p>

        <p>So she began: ‘O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!’</p>

        <p>The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively but said nothing.</p>

        <p>'Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; 'I daresay it's a French mouse.' So she tried again: 'Ou est ma chatte?'</p>

        <p>The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright. 'Oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice hastily. 'I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'</p>

        <p>'Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. 'Would you like cats if you were me?'</p>

        <p>'Well, perhaps not,' said Alice, in a soothing tone. 'Don't be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah!'</p>

        <p>The Mouse was trembling down to the end of its tail.</p>

        <p>'Let us get to the shore,' it said in a low trembling voice, 'and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll understand why I hate cats and dogs.'</p>

        <p>It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.</p>
