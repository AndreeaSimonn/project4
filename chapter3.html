        <h2>Chapter 3: A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale</h2>
        <img src="images/alice_3_2.png" alt="dodo in a Caucus-race" class="center">

        <p>They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.</p>

        <p>The first question, of course, was how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes, it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them.</p>

        <p>At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, 'Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'll soon make you dry enough!'</p>

        <p>Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.</p>

        <p>'Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, 'are you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please!'</p>

        <p>‘William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders…'</p>

        <p>'Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.</p>

        <p>The Mouse did not notice and continued, ‘…Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him…’</p>

        <p>'Found what?' said the Duck.</p>

        <p>'Found it!' the Mouse replied rather crossly.</p>

        <p>Alice, still soaking wet, sighed. 'As wet as ever,' she said in a melancholy tone: 'it doesn't seem to dry me at all.'</p>

        <p>'In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, 'I move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies.'</p>
        

        <p>'What I was going to say,' said the Dodo, 'was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'</p>

        <p>'What is a Caucus-race?' asked Alice.</p>

        <p>'Why,' said the Dodo, 'the best way to explain it is to do it.'</p>

        <p>And so they began to race in a circle—without a start or finish—until they were all dry.</p>

        <p>Finally, the Dodo called out, ‘The race is over!’</p>

        <p>'But who has won?' they asked.</p>

        <p>'Everybody has won, and all must have prizes,' said the Dodo.</p>

        <p>Alice, confused, handed out a box of comfits to all the creatures.</p>

        <p>'But she must have a prize herself!' said the Mouse.</p>

        <p>'Only a thimble,' said Alice.</p>

        <p>The Dodo took it and solemnly presented it back to Alice: ‘We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble.’</p>

        <p>Alice thought it all very absurd, but she didn’t dare laugh.</p>

        <p>The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused noise and confusion.</p>

        <p>After settling down, Alice turned to the Mouse, ‘You promised to tell me your history, you know.’</p>

        <p>‘Mine is a long and a sad tale!’ said the Mouse.</p>

        <p>Alice, looking at the Mouse's tail, thought it meant a “long tail” rather than a “long tale.”</p>

        <pre>
          'Fury said to a
          mouse, That he
          met in the
          house,
          "Let us
          both go to
          law…"
        </pre>

        <p>‘You are not attending!’ said the Mouse sharply.</p>

        <p>Alice, startled, apologized. ‘I beg your pardon.’</p>

        <p>But the Mouse, offended, walked away.</p>

        <p>‘Please come back and finish your story!’ Alice called, but the Mouse shook its head and left.</p>

        <p>'What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory.</p>

        <p>'I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud.</p>

        <p>'And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?' asked the Lory.</p>

        <p>Alice eagerly explained about Dinah, her cat, but this caused a commotion among the birds.</p>

        <p>One old Magpie wrapped itself up, ‘I must be getting home!’</p>

        <p>Alice, left alone, felt very lonely. 'I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself.</p>

        <p>In a little while, she heard pattering footsteps and looked up, half-hoping the Mouse had changed its mind.</p>
