        <h2>Chapter 1: Down the Rabbit Hole</h2>
        <img src="images/alicesmall_door.png" alt="Alice discovering a small door behind the curtain" class="center">

        <p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it.</p>

        <p>So she was considering in her own mind whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>

        <p>There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!'</p>

        <p>In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p>

        <p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.</p>

        <p>Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next.</p>

        <p>Presently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward!'</p>

        <p>Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!' (Dinah was the cat.)</p>

        <p>And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do bats eat cats?'</p>

        <p>Suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p>

        <p>Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.</p>

        <p>Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key.</p>

        <p>She opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole. She knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden she had ever seen.</p>

        <p>There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, hoping she might find another key on it, but instead, she found a little bottle on it, labeled ‘DRINK ME.’</p>

        <p>Alice hesitated. ‘No, I'll look first,’ she said, ‘and see whether it's marked "poison" or not.’</p>

        <img src="images/alice_and_thebottle.png" alt="Alice and the bottle" class="center">

        <p>However, this bottle was not marked ‘poison,’ so Alice ventured to taste it. It had a sort of mixed flavor of cherry-tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast.</p>

        <p>‘What a curious feeling!’ said Alice; ‘I must be shutting up like a telescope.’</p>

        <p>And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high. She felt a little nervous about this, wondering if she might shrink further.</p>

        <p>‘Come, there's no use in crying like that!’ said Alice to herself, rather sharply. Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table.</p>

        <p>She opened it and found in it a very small cake, on which the words ‘EAT ME’ were beautifully marked in currants.</p>

        <p>‘Well, I'll eat it,’ said Alice, ‘and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door.’</p>

        <p>So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</p>
